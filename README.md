# Drunk Grasshopper

# Overview
Drunk grasshopper is a site for want to be wine enthusiasts.  In practice, it works a lot like a small scale wine log to keep notes on what you drink as you explore new wines.  As the project builds out, it will become more clear that there is a focus on Napa Valley Wines.
